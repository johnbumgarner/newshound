## Description

<p align="justify"> 
	<i>NewsHound</i> is a <i>Python 3</i> module that was designed to perform high quality news and article extraction for sources in multiple languages.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
	For instance <i>NewsHound</i> cleanly parses article content from <a href="https://www.bbc.com">the BBC</a> in English, the <a href="https://www.bhaskar.com">Dainik Bhaskar</a> in Hindi, the <a href="https://www.people.com.cn">People's Daily</a> in Chinese, the <a href="https://www.manoramaonline.com">Malayala Manorama</a> in Malayalam and the <a href=" www.khaosod.co.th">Khaosod</a> in Thai.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
	The builtin extraction architecture is designed to systematically parse specific data elements from the underlying navigation structure of either an online web page or an offline file containing HTML content.  
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
These data elements are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> Title/Headline</li>
	<li> Description/Summary</li>
	<li> Keywords </li>
	<li> Name(s) of Author(s) </li>
	<li> Main Text/Content </li>
	<li> ISO Language </li>
	<li> Language Name </li>
	<li> Published Date </li>
	<li> Modified Date </li>
	<li> Canonical HREF </li>
	<li> Top Image HREF </li>
</ul>

## Predefined Extraction

<p align="justify">
The maintainers of <i>NewsHound</i> have developed and tested multiple <a href="https://github.com/johnbumgarner/newshound/blob/master/predefined_extraction_sources.md">predefined extraction modules</a> for various news sources around the world.  These specific extractors were developed to ensure consistent and accurate parsing from the news sources being queried. Additional sources will be added periodically to this predefined extraction list.
